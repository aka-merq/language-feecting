# #FEECTING MANUAL

## DISCLAIMER
> This is all for the sake of #ART. Come up with your own ideas. Copy+Paste the ideas of others you like. Come up with silly script. Or write what ever you like. It's all for the sake of #ART, and enhancing the #FUTURE of #FEECTING #AWESOME.

## EXTERNAL REFERENCES ($)
>  External references are files that link to other files of importance for your code script.  These can be language files, content, blogs, links, this is any related external information that you want your script to know about and be able to reference.

`$EXTERNAL = the link to the external reference`

## USER VARIABLES (@)

> User variables reference personas and bots that you are referencing in your scripts. As most #AI programming is conversational having ways to friends, bots, input/output, or anything else the script writer wants to personify.

`@USER = *link or reference to user*`

## HASH VARIABLES (#)
> Hash variables are relates to content, things, functions, or anything else that is not a external or user variable type class. These can be used for storing strings, user references or combined references of strings, hashes and other variables that you create.

`#HASH = string list or references to other strings/variables`  

## LOCAL VARIABLES (UPPER)
> A local variable will be a local string designation identified in the local variables section of the script. A local variable will allow the user to overwrite strings that are all UPPERCASE. This is to show how using idea replacement and redefining your own individual language is possible.

`LOCAL = local variable reference to strings, definitions, or other`


## ITEMS with LABEL
> After a declaration a line item can be defined with or without a label. Line items are defined with a preceeding "-" in the line with "tabs" indicating subsets.

```
if: condition is met
  - content
  - label: content
```

---

## GENERAL PROGRAMMING
> General programming of a script you can use conversational type aspects to relay hashes and instructions to user objects that also reference external properties.

```
Hi #DEVA, I'm @quinn. I would like to introduce you to the $FEECTING programming language.

```

> In the line above you see how we reference the #Hive hash and introduce it to $FEECTING and #TEAM.

```
if: MEMEBER in #TEAM
  - offer: #PROTECTION to MEMBER;

then: you do this
  - content
  - label: content

else: this happens
  - foo: bar baz bing bang

finally: this happens
  - end clause
```

> This is for an AI @Deva who while in #TEAM hash will issue some type of #PROTECTION which could be defined in one of the external references that the AI finds in another scope.

### IF, THEN, ELSE, FINALLY
```
if: @deva in #TEAM send an #OFFERING
  then: develop Algorithms
  else: send @deva message to join #TEAM
  finally: collect Data
```

### FOR, IF, THEN, ELSE

```
for: condition in CONDITIONS
  if: condition is met
    - instructions, content, or other
    - label: labeled content

  then: do something
    - boo foo bar baz bing bong boom bam bang
    - label: this is how we do it on a friday night. ðŸ’©
    - creative: get creative ðŸ‘½ðŸ§ 
    - inspire: use your imagination
    - create: creative structures generate great art.

  else: do something else
    - give: ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©
```

### FOR, IF THEN, ELSE, FINALLY

```
for: condition in CONDITIONS
  if: condition is something
    - do: this thing here
    - talk: @deva send deva a message if this condition is met.
    - think: this is my thought for this action.
    - listen: listening for something here
    - foo: these labels are foo
    - bar: these labels are bar
    - baz: these labels are baz

  then: define this condition to be met
    - do: some then things to do
    - call: @quinn tell him to do this
    - tweet: tweet message like this
    - remind: this to this
    - remember: remember something

  else: do something else
    - set: instructions for else things

  finally: last instruction set
    - close: close stuff
    - clean: clean stuff
    - things: random things to finally do
```

> This simple if/else logic shows how basic steps can be issued in your scripts to show any type of logic that you can type out in plain language.  Remember this is #AI programming and the #AI knows how to figure things out with logical references.

```
while: MEMBER in #TEAM
  - send: MEMBER #FEECTING
```

> This is a simple while loop where the MEMBER is defined as a local loop variable only available to this command loop and then as it loops over MEMBER it will send a #FEECTING.

```
when: MEMBER enters #TEAM
  - send: MEMBER #GREETING
```

```
during: MEMBER with #TEAM
  - include: RELATIONSHIPS
```

```
after: MEMBER leaves #TEAM
  - clean: PROFILE
```
