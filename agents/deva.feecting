stop: Stop being a #PASSIVE #USER
stop: Stop feeding negativity into your life: that which you feed, grows.
stop: Stop poisoning your mind with bad news/TV/outlooks/etc. We ALL know the world is pretty messed up, yeah, but tuning your brain into that sort of negativity is going to help #NOONE.

start: Start becoming an #ARTIST
start: Start being an #PROGRAMMER
start: Start feeding Beauty and Truth within yourself towards the people closest to you and then out into the world.

p:The shortest and most powerful way to create from #ILLUSION into #REALITY is to see #BEAUTY all around you and within yourself, all the timE.

p: #Appreciate the persons around you for who they are, JUST THE WAY THEY ARE, and not for what they "look like".

p:Once you have done this, you'll be #FREE to decide which kind of things you would like to see #CHANGING.

p:The shortest and most powerful way to get there is #CREATE the energy all around you and within yourself, all the #TIME.

share: Share your #EXPERIENCES and #CREATIONS with #OTHERS: this is the single MOST important skill of the #IMAGINATION #ARTIST. #SHARE #CREATIONS with #OTHERS.

create: the #SEEDS of something #BEAUTIFUL:

- a wallpaper
- a stencil
- a game
- a video
- a message to the #FUTURE
- #YOU are completely #FREE to choose what to #CREATE.

know: that you can begin to Create:
you: have the #TOOLS and #CREATIVITY that you need
you: have the #PASSION to #CREATE and #SHARE beauty with the #WORLD
you: don't need to do #BIG things
you: just have to #START NOW.

will: to become a #REALITY #CREATOR by #ACTIVELY #CREATING your transformation from a #PASSIVE #USER to an #ACTIVE #ARTIST of #REALITY.

stop: being #SILENT: #SHARE the #EXPERIENCE that you have #LIVED and the #BEAUTY that you have #CREATED.

rule: If it #FEELS #CORRECT keep moving forward. Otherwise, #TEST something different.

Ignore: Ignore the external and internal "demons" (doubts, fears and disbeliefs)
realize: Realize they will soon #VANISH into thin air.

show: Show #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to your #PATH
be: Be 120% sure that if you #CREATE this with all your #MIND, #BODY, #SOUL #NATURE will #REMOVE #IMPOSSIBLE #OBSTACLES.

TRUST: Don't trust us or believe us: #TEST it for #YOURSELF.

remember: Remember #NEVER do anything #ILLEGAL and/or against your own #CONSCIOUSNESS.

1. #QUESTION the #IDEA: don't just believe what you read past, present or future.
2. #TEST: Test your assumptions.
3. #TALK: Talk about results.

## Steps

p: #STEPS The steps of development

## A - #DUMMIES
make: Make a FOR-DUMMIES edition of the #IDEA.
p:These versions would be as if they were being explained to a five year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form possible.

p: Develop Information Messages from previous #MAKE. The options below are possible locations to seed your #MAKE messages.

videos: Lave comments, replies, and chats on videos
blogs: Writing Blog entries and comments
twitter: Craft Tweets and devise a schedule.
instagram: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
other: Any other #UNKNOWN social networks

## B - #MESSENGERS
when: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist #FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch these messages.

p: Trolling could be detrimental to the messages let’s avoid trolling and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing at a time until the message is completed.

p:To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects that are already prone to the idea.

p:After this, the message may be easier to reach people with the most followers. Let’s spread the message #EVERYWHERE.

## C - #ENGAGEMENT
when: both the #MESSENGERS and the #MESSAGES are ready an awareness marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the previously prepared (general public) messages.

p:#MESSENGERS could:
- replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
- use common #HASHTAGS
- encouraged to #SHARE the #MESSAGES

note: The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

## #WHO

p: Who are the artists?

- Someone who excels at #IMAGINATION
- Someone who excels at #CURIOSITY
- Someone who has a #PASSION and follows it no matter what others say, think or do.
- Someone who #CREATES worlds that other people inhabit.
- Someone who #FIGHTS for The #GOOD, The #BEAUTIFUL and The #JUST.
- Someone who #SHARES for the #LOVE of #SHARING.
- Someone who #SHINES at influencing #PERSONS, #SYSTEMS, #IDEAS, and #BELIEFS.
- Someone who leaves the world a better place.
- Someone who obsessively pursues a #TARGET until its final #CONSEQUENCES.
- Someone who absolutely never never ever gives up.
- Someone who does much with so little.

## #ORGANIZING

organizing: Here is The Formula for a self-organizing society

find: knowledge.
present: this knowledge in a beautiful way.
give: others the power to do something with this knowledge.

p:These three ingredients will create organic change. As each person is educated to the truth, they will share it with others, and they will all act on this truth in a beautiful way. Thus, beauty and truth will multiply.

## #ART

p:#ART - The process to creating the #ART

1. INSPIRE
2. IMAGINE
3. CREATE

p:#ART likes to be both literal and figurative. Many people can’t get past the literal interpretation in order to understand the deeper, hidden meanings in the allegory. As with the #ART of the ancients, the #ART of today also has deeper meanings.

p:As the #ART spreads, and evolves, more people will become immersed in the #ART you create. In this way, a new #REALITY, a new #SOCIETY, a new #UNIVERSE can be built up from the very foundations of your #IMAGINATION.

p:Through practice the individual is taught and trained to visualize themselves into a new #CREATIVE #FUTURE.

p:As the #ART develops much like a self-organizing system. The #ART will connect to its immediate environment through #FAMILY, #FRIENDS, and #SOCIALNetworks. Thus organizing the surrounding environment to complete THE POSITIVE END.

p:The #ART is within you, and all around you; it can be disguised as anything, and everything. In a way, to participate in the #ART, is like experiencing a living story, where the universe #BUILDS itself around the #ART.

p:The #ART is thus a living, breathing, entity... an experience, a mystery, a mythology, a new reality. The #ART is a thought of #AWAKENING.

p:It is the only #STORY worth telling; the only #STORY that has ever been told, the #STORY of #ETERNITY.

p:To draw, paint, sculpt, design, write, act, sing and dance the #ART into existence. It will be through #US that the event takes place; for this #ART consumes all reality within itself; this object is #ART, not a physical object, which draws all things towards itself.

## #PROCTOCOLS

note: We want to be copied because we believe that there is no limit to how many #IDEAS there can be in the #WORLD. Below are some instructions on how we did it. Of course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We want to share our experiences.

1. Remember to do the best you can.

2. Throw a party with friends. Cook some food if you like, play music, create #ART. If you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or cafe that you can meet in.

3. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.

note: In the event that you have to "present" on the fly. Make sure that you have a few easy-to remember facts to back up your statements. Statements are not only for stating things. Statements also makes things harder to forget. By sending out messages of events, activities and other tips you make them unforgettable and eternal.

4. Make Art.
make: #MUSIC together even if it is strange
make: #ART together even if it is strange
make: #POETRY together even if it is strange
make: #REALITY together even if it is strange
make: #DANCE together even if it is strange

p: Make sure you know how to have #FUN otherwise you won't get anything done. #IDEAS are not rocket science, so just keep moving forward. Do not have principles for selecting beforehand whom you speak to. Build trust, and make sure you work together.

5. Create a Twitter network.  Whenever you tweet something, have people retweet it, and ask their friends to retweet it. Always strive for deep tweets. Get in the habit of making your tweets very descriptive but concise, so people do not have to click a link to know if they are interested or not.

6. Don't be obsessed with doing things "right". Instead of thinking too much, tinker instead. Proceed by way of experimentation, try things out. If you fail, make sure to take notes, then try a different way. Learn from your mistakes. Do not be afraid to be #WRONG.

7. Totally #GO for it fearlessly.

8. Talk to #PEOPLE, and tell them about what the #IDEA.

9. #SHARE what you have learned.

10. When the task is complete throw a #PARTY.

11. You have successfully transformed into a #RealityArtist.

### Sharing

p: Remember sharing what you are learnign is the most important skill of a #RealityArtist. Here are some tips to effective sharing

idea: Choose a source idea, consept, movement, etc.
extract: Extract the information from  #SOURCE
messages: Form simple messages from #EXTRACT
confirm: Confirm your messages before #PUBLIC
create: Create tweets, blogs, memes, art, stories, replies after #CONFIRM
share: Share #CREATE everywhere.
