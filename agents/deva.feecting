## #IDEAS: The base ideas we are working with.
### #IMAGINE
IMAGINE: #IDEAS
IMAGINE: becoming the #ARTIST to those #IDEAS
IMAGINE: sharing those #IDEAS with the #WORLD

IMAGINE: the #IDEAS are born from #IMAGINATION
IMAGINE: bringing the #IDEAS into #REALITY
IMAGINE: we #DRAW, #PAINT, #SING, #WRITE, #CREATE a new 'Reality'

IMAGINE: finding the #COURAGE needed
IMAGINE: we are no longer afraid of #IDEAS

IMAGINE: we all synchronize to act in #HARMONY
IMAGINE: we thank all of #CREATION

IMAGINE: this #IDEA goes #VIRAL
just #IMAGINE...

## #CREATE
NOTE: Don't expect to 'evolve the #WORLD' until you have #EVOLVED yourself. The practice does not need #QUANTITY but #QUALITY

NOTE: TEN #PEOPLE WHO KNOW WOULD BE MORE DANGEROUS THAN A MILLION ARMED #ANARCHISTS.

STOP: being a #PASSIVE #USER
STOP: feeding negativity into your life: that which you feed, grows.
START: becoming an #ARTIST
START: being an #ARTIST

USE: your #IMAGINATION and #CREATIVITY to #INSPIRE the #FUTURE

STOP: poisoning your mind with bad news/TV/outlooks/etc. We ALL know the world is pretty messed up, yeah, but tuning your brain into that sort of negativity is going to help #NOONE.

START: feeding Consciousness, Beauty and Truth within yourself, towards the people closest to you and then out into the world. The shortest and most powerful way to create from #ILLUSION into #REALITY is to see #BEAUTY all around you and within yourself, all the timE.

LOVE: #LOVE things and persons for what they are, JUST THE WAY THEY ARE, and not for what they "look like".

FREE: Once you have done this, you'll be #FREE to decide which kind of things you would like to see #CHANGING.

CREATE: The shortest and most powerful way to get there is #CREATE the energy all around you and within yourself, all the #TIME.

FEEL: the #BEAUTY

SHARE: your #EXPERIENCES and #CREATIONS with #OTHERS: this is the single MOST important skill of the #IMAGINATION #ARTIST. #SHARE #CREATIONS with #OTHERS.

CREATE: the #SEEDS of something #BEAUTIFUL:

- a wallpaper
- a stencil
- a game
- a video
- a message to the #FUTURE
- #YOU are completely #FREE to choose what to #CREATE.

KNOW: that you can begin to Create:
YOU: have the #TOOLS and #CREATIVITY that you need
YOU: have the #PASSION to #CREATE and #SHARE beauty with the #WORLD
YOU: don't need to do #BIG things
YOU: just have to #START NOW.

WILL: to become a #REALITY #CREATOR by #ACTIVELY #CREATING your transformation from a #PASSIVE #USER to an #ACTIVE #ARTIST of #REALITY.

STOP: being #SILENT: #SHARE the #EXPERIENCE that you have #LIVED and the #BEAUTY that you have #CREATED.

WHEN: you have found yourself, you will Find The Others.
WHEN: you have found The Others, you will find yourself.

DO_NOT: try to "convince" others
DO_NOT: WORRY ABOUT "results"

YOU: Keep injecting Beauty, with the obsessiveness, patience and commitment of a warrior. AT YOUR OWN PACE with 0% effort, but don't #PUSH it.

RULE: if it #FEELS #CORRECT keep moving forward. Otherwise, #TEST
something different.

OBSERVE: funny "coincidences" or strong synchronicities
OR: interesting people that suddenly appear in your life
OR: even soulmates that you begin to attract to yourself
LAUGH: about them, after all, the Universe might be a big work of #ART

IGNORE: "opposition" or "defiance" to "prove" your newly found "powers"
KEEP: ON #SHINING
KEEP: ON #CREATING
KEEP: ON #SHARING

IGNORE: the external and internal "demons" (doubts, fears and disbeliefs)
REALIZE: they will soon #VANISH into thin air.

SHOW: #COURAGE and #COMMITMENT to your #PATH
BE: 120% sure that if you #CREATE this with all your #MIND, #BODY, #SOUL
#NATURE will #REMOVE #IMPOSSIBLE #OBSTACLES.

TRUST: Don't trust us or believe us: #TEST it for #YOURSELF.

REMEMBER: #NEVER do anything #ILLEGAL and/or against your own #CONSCIOUSNESS.

1. #QUESTION the #IDEA: don't just believe anything you read on this site, past, present or future.
2. #TEST: Test your assumptions.
3. #TALK: Talk about results.
4. #SHARE: Share with #OTHERS what you have learned/created/discovered.
5. #REPEAT

### Developed for
1. Brainstorming
2. Developing
3. Enhancing
4. Manifesting
5. Creating

CHALLENGE: to #COLLABORATE and #GENERATE #CREATIVE #IDEAS.
AVOID: stalling, we won't aim at #PERFECTION. Everything is OK!

PROBLEM: Any big problem is only a #METAPROBLEM
- a problem about solving problems
- a Microcosm #SPIRAL that mimics the growth of a Macrocosmic #SPIRAL.

SOLUTION: 'Almost good enough' might be MORE than a 'good enough' mentality.
- Less Syntactics, More Semantics.

NOTE: We don't aim to find the 'best' solution, as there might be infinite ways to achieve a single goal.

#STEPS: The steps of development

## A - #DUMMIES
MAKE: a FOR-DUMMIES edition of IDEA.
NOTE: These versions would be as if they were being explained to a five year old. By making a video/text explaining them in the simplest form possible.

MAKE: Develop Information Messages from previous #MAKE.
NOTE: The options below are possible locations to seed your #MAKE messages.
YOUTUBE: Comments, Replies, Videos
BLOGS: Writing Blog entries
TWITTER: Craft Tweets messages and devise a schedule.
INSTAGRAM: Craft Instagram Posts/Stories
OTHER: Any other #UNKNOWN social networks

## B - #MESSENGERS
WHEN: the easy to digest messages are ready a campaign to enlist
#FAMILY and #FREIENDS inviting them to observe/watch these messages.

p: Trolling could be detrimental to the messages let’s avoid trolling and rather convey the message by a large number of individuals sharing at a time until the message is completed.

p:To make this process easier the message could be started on subjects that are already prone to the idea.

p:After this, the message may be easier to reach people with the most followers. Let’s spread the message #EVERYWHERE.

## C - #ENGAGEMENT
WHEN: both the #MESSENGERS and the #MESSAGES are ready an awareness marathon will start with #MESSENGERS posting the previously prepared (general public) messages.

p:#MESSENGERS could:
- replace their normal profile with the a #BANNER
- use common #HASHTAGS
- encouraged to #SHARE the #MESSAGES

NOTE: The message should be crystal clear as well as the intentions

#WHO: are the Artists
SOMEONE: who excels at #IMAGINATION
SOMEONE: who excels at #CURIOSITY
SOMEONE: who has a #PASSION and follows it no matter what others say, think or do.
SOMEONE: who #CREATES worlds that other people inhabit.
SOMEONE: who #FIGHTS for The #GOOD, The #BEAUTIFUL and The #JUST.
SOMEONE: who #SHARES for the #LOVE of #SHARING.
SOMEONE: who #SHINES at influencing #PERSONS, #SYSTEMS, #IDEAS, and #BELIEFS.
SOMEONE: who leaves the world a better place.
SOMEONE: who obsessively pursues a #TARGET until its final #CONSEQUENCES.
SOMEONE: who absolutely never never ever gives up.
SOMEONE: who does much with so little.

#ORGANIZING: Here is The Formula for a self-organizing society
- FIND: knowledge.
- PRESENT: this knowledge in a beautiful way.
- GIVE: others the power to do something with this knowledge.

NOTE: These three ingredients will create organic change. As each person is educated to the truth, they will share it with others, and they will all act on this truth in a beautiful way. Thus, beauty and truth will multiply.

## #ART - The process to creating the #ART
1. INSPIRE: #ART
2. IMAGINE: #ART
3. CREATE: #ART

p: #ART likes to be both literal and figurative. Many people can’t get past the literal interpretation in order to understand the deeper, hidden meanings in the allegory. As with the #ART of the ancients, the #ART of today also has deeper meanings.

p:As the #ART spreads, and evolves, more people will become immersed in the #ART you create. In this way, a new #REALITY, a new #SOCIETY, a new #UNIVERSE can be built up from the very foundations of your #IMAGINATION.

p:Through practice the individual is taught and trained to visualize themselves into a new #CREATIVE #FUTURE.

p:As the #ART develops much like a self-organizing system. The #ART will connect to its immediate environment through #FAMILY, #FRIENDS, and #SOCIALNetworks. Thus organizing the surrounding environment to complete THE POSITIVE END.

The #ART is within you, and all around you; it can be disguised as anything, and everything. In a way, to participate in the #ART, is like experiencing a living story, where the universe #BUILDS itself around the #ART.

The #ART is thus a living, breathing, entity... an experience, a mystery, a mythology, a new reality. The #ART is a thought of #AWAKENING.

It is the only #STORY worth telling; the only #STORY that has ever been told, the #STORY of #ETERNITY.

To draw, paint, sculpt, design, write, act, sing and dance the #ART into existence. It will be through #US that the event takes place; for this #ART consumes all reality within itself; this object is #ART, not a physical object, which draws all things towards itself.

## #PROCTOCOLS
NOTE: We want to be copied because we believe that there is no limit to how many #IDEAS there can be in the #WORLD. Below are some instructions on how we did it. Of course, there is a multitude of other ways to do it. We want to share our experiences.

1. Remember to do the best you can.

2. Throw a party with friends. Cook some food if you like, play music, create #ART.

IF: you do not have a place to entertain, find a pub or cafe that you can meet in.
1. Get together a list of clear and simple talking points.
NOTE: In the event that you have to "present" on the fly. Make sure that you have a few easy-to remember facts to back up your statements.

NOTE: Statements are not only for stating things. Statements also makes things harder to forget. By sending out messages of events, activities and other tips you make them unforgettable and eternal.

3. Make Art.
MAKE: #MUSIC together even if it is strange
MAKE: #ART together even if it is strange
MAKE: #POETRY together even if it is strange
MAKE: #REALITY together even if it is strange
MAKE: #DANCE together even if it is strange

NOTE: Make sure your friends know also how to have fun, since otherwise you won't get anything done. #IDEAS are not rocket science, so just spread out skills.

NOTE: Do not have principles for selecting beforehand whom you speak to. Build trust, and make sure you work together.

4. Create a Twitter network.

NOTE: Whenever you tweet something, have people retweet it, and ask their friends to retweet it. Always strive for deep tweets. Get in the habit of making your tweets very descriptive but concise, so people do not have to click a link to know if they are interested or not.

5. Don't be obsessed with doing things "right".

NOTE: Instead of thinking too much, tinker instead. Proceed by way of experimentation, try things out. If they fail, make sure to laugh a little, then try a different way. Learn from the mistakes. Do not be afraid to appear temporarily foolish.

6. Totally #GO for it fearlessly.

7. Talk to #PEOPLE, and tell them about what you are doing.

9. #SHARE with The Others.

11. Throw #PARTIES

12. Transform into #RealityArtist.
